Clock synchronization
---------------------

Here we talk about important functions like the local clock
(:func:`lsl_local_clock`), a function to query a time offset
(:func:`lsl_time_correction_ex`) and a function to get the library version used
by the loaded library (:func:`lsl_library_version`).

Creating outlets
----------------

The main outlet class is :class:`lsl::stream_outlet`.
